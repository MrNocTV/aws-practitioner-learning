## AWS Free Tier

- The AWS Free Tier enables you to begin using certain services without having to worry about incurring costs for the specified period. 

- Three types of offers are available: 

    * Always Free
    * 12 Months Free
    * Trials

- Always Free: These offers do not expire and are available to all AWS customers.
    * For example, AWS Lambda allows 1 million free requests and up to 3.2 million seconds of compute time per month. Amazon DynamoDB allows 25 GB of free storage per month.

- 12 Months Free: These offers are free for 12 months following your initial sign-up date to AWS.

- Trials: Short-term free trial offers start from the date you activate a particular service. The length of each trial might vary by number of days or the amount of usage in the service.

## How AWS pricing works

AWS offers a range of cloud computing services with pay-as-you-go pricing. 

- Pay for what you use: For each service, you pay for exactly the amount of resources that you actually use, without requiring long-term contracts or complex licensing. 

- Pay less when you reserve: Some services offer reservation options that provide a significant discount compared to On-Demand Instance pricing.

- Pay less with volume-based discounts when you use more: Some services offer tiered pricing, so the per-unit cost is incrementally lower with increased usage.

## AWS Pricing Calculator

- The AWS Pricing Calculator lets you explore AWS services and create an estimate for the cost of your use cases on AWS. You can organize your AWS estimates by groups that you define. A group can reflect how your company is organized, such as providing estimates by cost center.

- Suppose that your company is interested in using Amazon EC2. However, you are not yet sure which AWS Region or instance type would be the most cost-efficient for your use case. In the AWS Pricing Calculator, you can enter details such as the kind of operating system you need, memory requirements, and input/output (I/O) requirements. By using the AWS Pricing Calculator, you can review an estimated comparison of different EC2 instance types across AWS Regions.

### AWS pricing examples

This section presents a few examples of pricing in AWS services. 

- AWS Lambda: For AWS Lambda, you are charged based on the number of requests for your functions and the time that it takes for them to run.

    * AWS Lambda allows 1 million free requests and up to 3.2 million seconds of compute time per month.

    * You can save on AWS Lambda costs by signing up for a Compute Savings Plan. A Compute Savings Plan offers lower compute costs in exchange for committing to a consistent amount of usage over a 1-year or 3-year term. This is an example of paying less when you reserve. 

- Amazon S3: 
    * Storage: You pay for only the storage that you use
    * Requests and data retrievals: You pay for requests made to your Amazon S3 objects and buckets
    * Data transfer: There is no cost to transfer data between different Amazon S3 buckets or from Amazon S3 to other services within the same AWS Region. However, you pay for data that you transfer into and out of Amazon S3, with a few exceptions. There is no cost for data transferred into Amazon S3 from the internet or out to Amazon CloudFront. There is also no cost for data transferred out to an Amazon EC2 instance in the same AWS Region as the Amazon S3 bucket.
    * Management and replication: You pay for the storage management features that you have enabled on your account’s Amazon S3 buckets. These features include Amazon S3 inventory, analytics, and object tagging.

- Use the AWS Billing & Cost Management dashboard to pay your AWS bill, monitor your usage, and analyze and control your costs.

## Consolidated billing

- In an earlier module, you learned about AWS Organizations, a service that enables you to manage multiple AWS accounts from a central location. AWS Organizations also provides the option for consolidated billing. 

- The consolidated billing feature of AWS Organizations enables you to receive a single bill for all AWS accounts in your organization. By consolidating, you can easily track the combined costs of all the linked accounts in your organization. The default maximum number of accounts allowed for an organization is 4, but you can contact AWS Support to increase your quota, if needed.

- Another benefit of consolidated billing is the ability to share bulk discount pricing, Savings Plans, and Reserved Instances across the accounts in your organization. For instance, one account might not have enough monthly usage to qualify for discount pricing. However, when multiple accounts are combined, their aggregated usage may result in a benefit that applies across all accounts in the organization.

## AWS Budgets

- In AWS Budgets, you can create budgets to plan your service usage, service costs, and instance reservations.

- The information in AWS Budgets updates three times a day. This helps you to accurately determine how close your usage is to your budgeted amounts or to the AWS Free Tier limits.

## AWS Cost Explorer

AWS Cost Explorer is a tool that enables you to visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time.

## AWS Support

AWS offers four different Support plans to help you troubleshoot issues, lower costs, and efficiently use AWS services. 

You can choose from the following Support plans to meet your company’s needs: 

- Basic
- Developer
- Business
- Enterprise

### Basic Support 
- is free for all AWS customers. It includes access to whitepapers, documentation, and support communities. With Basic Support, you can also contact AWS for billing questions and service limit increases.

- With Basic Support, you have access to a limited selection of AWS Trusted Advisor checks. Additionally, you can use the AWS Personal Health Dashboard, a tool that provides alerts and remediation guidance when AWS is experiencing events that may affect you. 

### Developer Support

- Customers in the Developer Support plan have access to features such as:

* Best practice guidance
* Client-side diagnostic tools
* Building-block architecture support, which consists of guidance for how to use AWS offerings, features, and services together

### Business Support
- Customers with a Business Support plan have access to additional features, including: 

* Use-case guidance to identify AWS offerings, features, and services that can best support your specific needs
* All AWS Trusted Advisor checks
* Limited support for third-party software, such as common operating systems and application stack components

### Enterprise Support
- In addition to all the features included in the Basic, Developer, and Business Support plans, customers with an Enterprise Support plan have access to features such as:

* Application architecture guidance, which is a consultative relationship to support your company’s specific use cases and applications
* Infrastructure event management: A short-term engagement with AWS Support that helps your company gain a better understanding of your use cases. This also provides your company with architectural and scaling guidance.
* A Technical Account Manager

### Technical Account Manager (TAM)

- The Enterprise Support plan includes access to a Technical Account Manager (TAM).

- If your company has an Enterprise Support plan, the TAM is your primary point of contact at AWS. They provide guidance, architectural reviews, and ongoing communication with your company as you plan, deploy, and optimize your applications. 

- Your TAM provides expertise across the full range of AWS services. They help you design solutions that efficiently use multiple services together through an integrated approach.

- For example, suppose that you are interested in developing an application that uses several AWS services together. Your TAM could provide insights into how to best use the services together. They achieve this, while aligning with the specific needs that your company is hoping to address through the new application.

## AWS Marketplace

- AWS Marketplace is a digital catalog that includes thousands of software listings from independent software vendors. You can use AWS Marketplace to find, test, and buy software that runs on AWS. 

- For each listing in AWS Marketplace, you can access detailed information on pricing options, available support, and reviews from other AWS customers.

- You can also explore software solutions by industry and use case. For example, suppose that your company is in the healthcare industry. In AWS Marketplace, you can review use cases that software helps you to address, such as implementing solutions to protect patient records or using machine learning models to analyze a patient’s medical history and predict possible health risks.
