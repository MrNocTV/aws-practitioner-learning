## Instance stores
Block-level storage volumes behave like physical hard drives

An instance store provides temporary block-level storage for an Amazon EC2 instance. An instance store is disk storage that is physically attached to the host computer for an EC2 instance, and therefore has the same lifespan as the instance. When the instance is terminated, you lose any data in the instance store.

## Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)

Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) is a service that provides block-level storage volumes that you can use with Amazon EC2 instances. If you stop or terminate an Amazon EC2 instance, all the data on the attached EBS volume remains available.

To create an EBS volume, you define the configuration (such as volume size and type) and provision it. After you create an EBS volume, it can attach to an Amazon EC2 instance.

Because EBS volumes are for data that needs to persist, it’s important to back up the data. You can take incremental backups of EBS volumes by creating Amazon EBS snapshots.

## Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)
- In object storage, each object consists of data, metadata, and a key.

- when you modify a file in block storage, only the pieces that are changed are updated. When a file in object storage is modified, the entire object is updated.

- Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is a service that provides object-level storage. Amazon S3 stores data as objects in buckets.

- Amazon S3 offers unlimited storage space. The maximum file size for an object in Amazon S3 is 5 TB.

- When you upload a file to Amazon S3, you can set permissions to control visibility and access to it. You can also use the Amazon S3 versioning feature to track changes to your objects over time.

### S3 Standard
- Designed for frequently accessed data
- Stores data in a minimum of three Availability Zones

### S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)
- Ideal for infrequently accessed data
- Similar to S3 Standard but has a lower storage price and higher retrieval price
- S3 Standard-IA is ideal for data infrequently accessed but requires high availability when needed. Both S3 Standard and S3 Standard-IA store data in a minimum of three Availability Zones. S3 Standard-IA provides the same level of availability as S3 Standard but with a lower storage price and a higher retrieval price.

### S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)
- Stores data in a single Availability Zone
- Has a lower storage price than S3 Standard-IA

### S3 Intelligent-Tiering
In the S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class, Amazon S3 monitors objects’ access patterns. If you haven’t accessed an object for 30 consecutive days, Amazon S3 automatically moves it to the infrequent access tier, S3 Standard-IA. If you access an object in the infrequent access tier, Amazon S3 automatically moves it to the frequent access tier, S3 Standard.

### S3 Glacier
- Low-cost storage designed for data archiving
- Able to retrieve objects within a few minutes to hours

### S3 Glacier Deep Archive
- Lowest-cost object storage class ideal for archiving
- Able to retrieve objects within 12 hours

When deciding between Amazon S3 Glacier and Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive, consider how quickly you need to retrieve archived objects. You can retrieve objects stored in the S3 Glacier storage class within a few minutes to a few hours. By comparison, you can retrieve objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class within 12 hours.



## Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)
### File storage
In file storage, multiple clients (such as users, applications, servers, and so on) can access data that is stored in shared file folders. In this approach, a storage server uses block storage with a local file system to organize files. Clients access data through file paths.

- Compared to block storage and object storage, file storage is ideal for use cases in which a large number of services and resources need to access the same data at the same time.

- Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) is a scalable file system used with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources. As you add and remove files, Amazon EFS grows and shrinks automatically. It can scale on demand to petabytes without disrupting applications. 

### Comparing Amazon EBS and Amazon EFS
.Comparing Amazon EBS and Amazon EFS
|===
| EBS | EFS

| - An Amazon EBS volume stores data in a single Availability Zone. 

- To attach an Amazon EC2 instance to an EBS volume, both the Amazon EC2 instance and the EBS volume must reside within the same Availability Zone. | 
- Amazon EFS is a regional service. It stores data in and across multiple Availability Zones. 

- The duplicate storage enables you to access data concurrently from all the Availability Zones in the Region where a file system is located. Additionally, on-premises servers can access Amazon EFS using AWS Direct Connect.

## Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)

- Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a service that enables you to run relational databases in the AWS Cloud.

- Amazon RDS is a managed service that automates tasks such as hardware provisioning, database setup, patching, and backups. With these capabilities, you can spend less time completing administrative tasks and more time using data to innovate your applications. You can integrate Amazon RDS with other services to fulfill your business and operational needs, such as using AWS Lambda to query your database from a serverless application.

- Amazon RDS provides a number of different security options. Many Amazon RDS database engines offer encryption at rest (protecting data while it is stored) and encryption in transit (protecting data while it is being sent and received).

### Amazon RDS database engines

Amazon RDS is available on six database engines, which optimize for memory, performance, or input/output (I/O). Supported database engines include:

- Amazon Aurora
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- MariaDB
- Oracle Database
- Microsoft SQL Server

### Amazon Aurora 
- is an enterprise-class relational database. It is compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL relational databases. It is up to five times faster than standard MySQL databases and up to three times faster than standard PostgreSQL databases.

Amazon Aurora helps to reduce your database costs by reducing unnecessary input/output (I/O) operations, while ensuring that your database resources remain reliable and available. 

Consider Amazon Aurora if your workloads require high availability. It replicates six copies of your data across three Availability Zones and continuously backs up your data to Amazon S3.

## Amazon DynamoDB

- Amazon DynamoDB is a key-value database service. It delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale.

- DynamoDB is serverless, which means that you do not have to provision, patch, or manage servers. 

- You also do not have to install, maintain, or operate software.

## Amazon Redshift

Amazon Redshift is a data warehousing service that you can use for big data analytics. It offers the ability to collect data from many sources and helps you to understand relationships and trends across your data.

## AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS)

AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) enables you to migrate relational databases, nonrelational databases, and other types of data stores.

With AWS DMS, you move data between a source database and a target database. The source and target databases can be of the same type or different types. During the migration, your source database remains operational, reducing downtime for any applications that rely on the database. 

- Development and test database migrations: Enabling developers to test applications against production data without affecting production users

- Database consolidation: Combining several databases into a single database

- Continuous replication: Sending ongoing copies of your data to other target sources instead of doing a one-time migration

## Additional database services
- Amazon DocumentDB: Amazon DocumentDB is a document database service that supports MongoDB workloads. (MongoDB is a document database program.)
