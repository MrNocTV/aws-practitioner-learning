        1- If you run a Linux instance for 4 seconds or 20 seconds or 59 seconds, you will be charged for one minute. (this is what we mean by minimum of 1 minute)

        2- If you run a Linux instance for 1 minute and 3 seconds, you will be charged for 1 minute and 3 seconds.

        3- If you run a Linux instance for 3 hours, 25 minutes and 7 seconds, you will be charged for 3 hours, 25 minutes and 7 seconds.

    ** Examples for non-Linux\Ubuntu instances:

        1- If you run an instance for 4 seconds or 20 seconds or 59 seconds, you will be charged for one hour.

        2- If you run an instance for 1 minute and 3 seconds, you will be charged for one hour.

        3- If you run an instance for 3 hours, 25 minutes and 7 seconds, you will be charged for 4 hours.

- Platform as a Service (PaaS) removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems) and allows you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications. This helps you be more efficient as you don’t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application. A common example of a PaaS platform is the AWS Elastic Beanstalk service. Developers simply upload their application, and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling, and application health monitoring.
